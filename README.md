For every news story there is an equal and opposite news story
In this age of siloed thought people often stick to their tried-and-true, it confirms my beliefs news sources with nary a thought, nor even an inkling of concern, for what the other side may have to say about the same subject. But what if you are not inclined to be just RED (Conservative) or just BLUE (Liberal) in your thoughts and opinions?
